QUESTION: That sounds like an interesting project. Could you please tell me more about that virtual try on system? What was the primary goal, and what were your specific responsibilities?
FEEDBACK: The answer provided a specific project, which is a good hook. However, it was very brief, so my follow-up question is designed to probe for more details about the project's purpose and their specific role.
